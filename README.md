The 10 Steps to Learning Vim
============================

Step 1
------

Step 1 is this, which is me asking you to take a leap of faith when I say: ignore everything that has been said about its difficulty.  It's not so bad, really.  The learning process is like a game where the controls need to be felt haptically and by touch, and the very first -- and only, in my opinion -- learning curve is figuring out how to get your cursor from line A to line B or C, comfortably, using your home row keys (`h`, `j`, `k` and `l`).  Once this strangeness has been overcome, things start to click.  It is a metaphor or sorts; train your hand to operate on those four, seemingly incompatible and strange commands, and the greatest learning curve has been overcome: the difficulty and anxiety of not being able to move.  This is very human and natural; like being able to walk, movement is freedom.  When people first boot Vim all of the techniques that they've learned to navigate over the years are no longer available, and so they shut down.  This is the key:  `h`, `j`, `k` and `l`, four commands:  `h` for left, `j` for down, `k` for up and `l` for right.  Keep this in the back of your mind as you read on.


Step 2

Step 2 is to think about your text editor for a second.  Like really think about it, and how much you use it.  If you're a Sublime Text user, remember when it first hit the scene?  Much of the joy came from users of TextMate, who felt as though their beloved environment had been abandoned, and it had. Sublime Text filled that gap by introducing a system for importing TextMate plugins as well as extending common functionality.  But it was a hassle, and now Sublime Text, too, seems to have followed in the wake of TextMate with stale releases and a fairly unresponsive development team.  You use your editor every day, generally for eight hours or more.  Editors come and go.  Vim, on the other hand, has persistence.  It is guaranteed to be on all Linux-based systems, and as such will continue to have developers adding and extending its core.  Vim will be the last text editor you will ever have to learn, and will ever need.  By taking steps to learn it you are making a substantial time investment in your future.


Step 3
------

Step 3 is recognizing that learning Vim is much more than just not having to learn other systems or adapt to change.  Vim is a way of thinking about editing text that is much more precise and more focused than other systems.  The subtitle of the book [Practical Vim](https://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim) says it all:  "Edit Text at the Speed of Thought".  Thinking:  how does visual perception work?  You sense something in the periphery that you want to focus on and your eyes move towards the subject.  By the time you've focused you've already had a thought about it, and by the time you've had a chance to **observe** you've already come to a conclusion.  Vim is the same way, but with the added benefit of being able to **act** (unfortunately you can't `move bird two trees over, three branches up` :/).  It allows us a pinpoint precision that mirrors the way that we already perceive things in the real world but with an immediate ability to manipulate the subject at hand.  As you get more proficient you find that there are no more intermediary steps; you think and the change occurs, literally.

Step 4

Step 4 is about learning from others, and particularly the doubters.  Read this post by the one and only Yehuda Katz, who tried, failed, and then realized he was simply looking at it from the wrong angle:  [Everyone Who Tried to Convince Me to use Vim was Wrong](http://yehudakatz.com/2010/07/29/everyone-who-tried-to-convince-me-to-use-vim-was-wrong/).

As well as this post from Jon Beltran de Heredia, which fills in the details and provides a few concrete examples:  [Why, oh WHY, do those #?@! nutheads use vi?](http://www.viemu.com/a-why-vi-vim.html)

Step 5
------

Step 5 is where you begin your quest.  *THIS IS IMPORTANT!*  Open up your terminal and type in `vimtutor`.  All of the basics are covered here, particularly navigation -- `h`, `j`, `k` and `l`.  It will feel weird, but complete it.  And then after, open up a text document and practice navigating around changing words.  Like I said in Step 1, being able to navigate in the most basic of ways serves to **break the fear**.  It will empower you to continue learning.  You cannot learn to run without knowing now to walk.  Those four commands are the most important.

Step 6
------

Step 6 is casting off on your own.  Vim, as it comes out of the box, is notoriously bare.  Lots of bare-bones functional things like copy/paste, tabs, syntax highlighting, etc, are turned off by default.  This is due to the need for maximum interoperability with existing environments as well as extensibility:  Vim is designed to give the user what he or she wants.  It does not mean that the options are not there, though unfortunately this can appear unclear.

Step 7
------

Once you're able to move about, you then need to ask yourself what the most important features of your current text editor are.  Do you like the fuzzy finder in Sublime Text?  The package manager which allows you to seamlessly extend the core functionality of your editor?  Do you like the ability to navigate between tabs and "ctrl-click" to Class definitions?  Autocomplete?  If so,
